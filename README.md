## Background

Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## Assignment
* Created a scatter plot between the two data variables of Healthcare vs. Poverty.
* Used the D3 techniques, taught to us in class, and created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.
    * state abbreviations are in the circles
    * Created and situated the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart
* Coded the graphic in app.js.

## Insights

There looks to be a positive correlation between the those that lack healthcare and poverty levels. Southern states tend to have the highest rates of poverty and less healthcare coverage (with Texas being an outlier as it has the highest % lacking healthcare) while some New England states have the lowest rates of poverty and lack of healthcare. I would also say the New Mexico is another outlier as it is simliar to some of the Southern states.
